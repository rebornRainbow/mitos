## Instruction and memory ordering 

It is natural to think of programs executing in the order in which source code statements appear. That’s a reasonable mental model for single-threaded code, but is incorrect when multiple threads interact through shared memory [2, 4]. One reason is that compilers emit load and store instructions in orders different from those implied by the source code, and may entirely omit them (for example by caching data in registers). Another reason is that the CPU may execute instructions out of order to increase performance. For example, a CPU may notice that in a serial sequence of instructions A and B are not dependent on each other. The CPU may start instruction B first, either because its inputs are ready before A’s inputs, or in order to overlap execution of A and B.

As an example of what could go wrong, in this code for push, it would be a disaster if the compiler or CPU moved the store corresponding to line 4 to a point after the release on line 6: 

l = malloc(sizeof *l); 

l->data = data; 

acquire(&listlock); 

l->next = list; 

list = l; 

release(&listlock); 

If such a re-ordering occurred, there would be a window during which another CPU could acquire the lock and observe the updated list, but see an uninitialized list->next.

The good news is that compilers and CPUs help concurrent programmers by following a set of rules called the memory model, and by providing some primitives to help programmers control re-ordering. 

To tell the hardware and compiler not to re-order, xv6 uses sync_synchronize() in both acquire (kernel/spinlock.c:22) and release (kernel/spinlock.c:47). sync_synchronize() is a memory barrier: it tells the compiler and CPU to not reorder loads or stores across the barrier. The barriers in xv6’s acquire and release force order in almost all cases where it matters, since xv6 uses locks around accesses to shared data. Chapter 9 discusses a few exceptions.

## Sleep locks 

Sometimes xv6 needs to hold a lock for a long time. For example, the file system (Chapter 8) keeps a file locked while reading and writing its content on the disk, and these disk operations can take tens of milliseconds. Holding a spinlock that long would lead to waste if another process wanted to acquire it, since the acquiring process would waste CPU for a long time while spinning. Another drawback of spinlocks is that a process cannot yield the CPU while retaining a spinlock; we’d like to do this so that other processes can use the CPU while the process with the lock waits for the disk. Yielding while holding a spinlock is illegal because it might lead to deadlock if a second thread then tried to acquire the spinlock; since acquire doesn’t yield the CPU, the second thread’s spinning might prevent the first thread from running and releasing the lock. Yielding while holding a lock would also violate the requirement that interrupts must be off while a spinlock is held. Thus we’d like a type of lock that yields the CPU while waiting to acquire, and allows yields (and interrupts) while the lock is held. 

Xv6 provides such locks in the form of sleep-locks. acquiresleep (kernel/sleeplock.c:22) yields the CPU while waiting, using techniques that will be explained in Chapter 7. At a high level, a sleep-lock has a locked field that is protected by a spinlock, and acquiresleep ’s call to sleep atomically yields the CPU and releases the spinlock. The result is that other threads can execute while acquiresleep waits. 

Because sleep-locks leave interrupts enabled, they cannot be used in interrupt handlers. Be- cause acquiresleep may yield the CPU, sleep-locks cannot be used inside spinlock critical sections (though spinlocks can be used inside sleep-lock critical sections).

## Real world 

Programming with locks remains challenging despite years of research into concurrency primitives and parallelism. It is often best to conceal locks within higher-level constructs like synchronized queues, although xv6 does not do this. If you program with locks, it is wise to use a tool that attempts to identify races, because it is easy to miss an invariant that requires a lock. 

Most operating systems support POSIX threads (Pthreads), which allow a user process to have several threads running concurrently on different CPUs. Pthreads has support for user-level locks, barriers, etc. Pthreads also allows a programmer to optionally specify that a lock should be re- entrant. 

Supporting Pthreads at user level requires support from the operating system. For example, it should be the case that if one pthread blocks in a system call, another pthread of the same process should be able to run on that CPU. As another example, if a pthread changes its process’s address space (e.g., maps or unmaps memory), the kernel must arrange that other CPUs that run threads of the same process update their hardware page tables to reflect the change in the address space. 

It is possible to implement locks without atomic instructions [10], but it is expensive, and most operating systems use atomic instructions. 

Locks can be expensive if many CPUs try to acquire the same lock at the same time. If one CPU has a lock cached in its local cache, and another CPU must acquire the lock, then the atomic instruction to update the cache line that holds the lock must move the line from the one CPU’s cache to the other CPU’s cache, and perhaps invalidate any other copies of the cache line. Fetching a cache line from another CPU’s cache can be orders of magnitude more expensive than fetching a line from a local cache. 

To avoid the expenses associated with locks, many operating systems use lock-free data struc- tures and algorithms [6, 12]. For example, it is possible to implement a linked list like the one in the beginning of the chapter that requires no locks during list searches, and one atomic instruction to insert an item in a list. Lock-free programming is more complicated, however, than programming locks; for example, one must worry about instruction and memory reordering. Programming with locks is already hard, so xv6 avoids the additional complexity of lock-free programming.
